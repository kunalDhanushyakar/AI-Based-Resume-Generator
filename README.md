# AI-Based-Resume-Generator
An AI-based Resume Generator uses React for the UI where users input details, Spring Boot as the backend to process requests, and Spring AI with DeepSeek to generate resume content via prompts. The AI returns structured JSON (skills, summary, experience), which React renders into downloadable resume templates.
